# Familiars

## Premise: 
This project is a website about a renting service for witchesâ€™ familiars. The first half of the page is informational about the various offerings, and the second half of the page is a form to apply to receive these services.

## Technologies used: 
This project is done entirely in HTML and CSS.

## What does it do: 
The website displays information on the various familiars offered and takes information on the consumer and the needs that could be fulfilled through the service (the webpage is not connected to any backend, so the inputs into the form are not saved anywhere).

## Challenges faced: 
I made this project for a freeCodeCamp responsive web design certification project. A challenge I faced was with the formatting of the form as well as some elements of the CSS, like the form elements and formatting the images.
